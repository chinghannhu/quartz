> ### **Am I working on what I most want to work on?** [[procrastination-breaker| >]]

>  ### **If I had 100 million in the bank, what would I do with my time?**  [[time-management-guide| >]]

To avoid the traps of procrastination and putting money first, I've placed these two sentences at the top of the Now page as a reminder. Constantly reminding myself, am I really doing what I most want to do?

Here are several articles to knock on my own head at the right time:

#### # Learning Basic Japanese 

Inspired by [[jp-Makoto|Makoto]]'s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59QlHqVOCKw) , who speaks three languages, native Japanese, Mandarin, and English, I've decided to try the [[comprehensible input]] language learning method. I'm now consuming plenty of Japanese content he recommends.

My past experience with learning Japanese only reached a few phrases and simple greetings, easily abandoned due to the grammar monster. Now I can confidently say I know hiragana and katakana. Though my ambition isn't as grand as becoming a Japanese native speaker or finding a job, there's a small voice inside me saying, if I can talk to Japanese people, that would be pretty awesome.

I believe the greatest benefit of learning a language is understanding different cultures. As Makoto shares, it inevitably changes the way you view the world. I see language as a flashlight; the more you learn, the larger the area you can illuminate, thus revealing a bigger world.

I aspire to immerse myself in the world of Japan.

# Why Now Page?
> For me, the biggest takeaway of the Now page is to remind myself to ***value the present***.

Reminding myself of things to focus on and enjoy in the moment, such as immersing myself in various topics I want to learn or creating freely.

During casual conversations with friends, the most common question is *"What are you doing now?"* Suddenly being asked by this, I might struggle to answer, and the question *"Do I really know what I'm doing?*" pops up in my mind often. In the process of reminiscing about the past and anticipating the future, I easily forget what I want to do and what I can do at the moment. 

Troubled by this situation for a while, I hope to firmly state what I am doing now, hence the writing of the Now page as a reminder.
