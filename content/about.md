Hey, I'm Hu.

This is a big page that I collect my life events and the process of discovering my true self. It's always challenging for me to introduce myself to others. I would like to jot down some simple and clear facts to remind myself that I'm a valuable person. I believe it's a good way to build my own self-worth. Also, thank you for stepping into my world ;)

## I’m Taiwanese
- **Somehow I speak poor Taiwanese.** Keep working on it.
- **Taiwan's food is the best.** Please don't fight with me. My guilty pleasure is hot pots and boba tea (or say any other hand-shaken drinks). Weirdly, starting drinking sugar-free milk tea from 2022. I used to drink half sugar. I also love Japanese food, 寿司 and うどん.
