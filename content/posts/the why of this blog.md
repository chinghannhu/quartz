## The Mindset of Building This Blog

我想寫讓自己開心的文字。

成為知識的創作者，不要成為知識的搬運者。

## Build Digital Garden

### Serve My Mind And Brain

A digital garden is essentially a concept rooted in personal knowledge management (PKM), often referred to as the "Second Brain." It's a space where individuals cultivate and curate their ideas, thoughts, and knowledge in a digital format.

The beauty of a digital garden lies in treating your ideas and content as living entities that are constantly evolving. They are like half-finished, medium-rare thoughts that have the potential to grow and develop over time.

Similar to the life cycle of a tree, ideas in a digital garden can be seen as seeds, seedlings, saplings, rhizomes, fruits, and evergreens, each representing different stages of growth and maturity.

If you're interested in diving deeper into this concept, you can explore the articles below:

## Satisfy The Vanity

### Sharing Life with Friends

I'm an oversharing person, but I hate repeating myself.

When I have something in mind to share with friends, I often find myself copy and paste multiple times. 

One of the reasons I want to start blogging is that it tremendously reduces the friction of sharing information with multiple friends. Instead of copying and pasting the same content again and again, I can simply direct my friends to my blog. 

This saves me so much time.

**Blogging provides me an efficient and enjoyable way.**

I can regularly share my thoughts and ideas with my friends. It also ensures that my content stays online and accessible whenever I want to revisit it. As long as I have internet access, I can easily reach my thoughts and ideas on my blog at any time.

Maybe you'll consider to start your own blog.
