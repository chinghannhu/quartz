## Keep in mind
1. **Never seek perfectionism.** 
2. **Have fun!** *Enjoy life every chance you get*. Remember to enjoy the moment or trick yourself by telling yourself you choose to do so, and ask yourself, "Isn't it supposed to be fun?"
3. Treat journal as your best friend, your ally, your playground, or your drawing pad. 
4. The journal is here to accompany you through every minute that I have something to express from my mind. Just like the notebook, Leuchtturm, the lighthouse is always here.
5. **Don't take it too seriously.** Write down the boredom, tiny things; these are all part of daily life. YOLO. You only live once. So enjoy every second. Every word, every sentence has its meaning, even if you can't see it yet. Just as Dr. Tsai once mentioned, "Everyone only has the chance to live one's life."
6. When you get stuck, simply ask yourself, "What's today's adventure?" or choose any [[journal prompts]] you would love to answer. GO AND HAVE FUN!
